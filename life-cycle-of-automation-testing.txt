Day 01: Life Cycle of Automation Testing

-> Today's Task: Look up some definitions for "Automation", compare them against definitions for "Test Automation".

-> What we will learn?
Ans> i) What is Automation>
     ans) Labor-saving technology is the technology.
          A process or procedure is performed with no or minimal human assistance.
          It can cover applications range from small thermostat to large scale productions.

     ii) Test Automation:
     ans) Automating the repetitive task.
          It is critical for CI/CD.
          Approach to Test Automation                |--> Headless Execution
                                    |--> GUI Testing-| 
                                    |                |--> Using Selenium and other tool   
                                    |--> API Testing
                                    |--> Continuous Testing
          Mostly used in Regression testing.
          The goal of automation testing is to reduce the number of test cases to be run manually.

     iii) Why we do Automation Testing?
     ans) Eliminate to manual efforts.
          Ad hoc Test cases are required to run.
          Rerun the critical or important cases continuously.
          Long manual flows are tidies.

     iv) Life Cycle of Automation Testing:
     ans) Scope of Automation.
          Selection of Automation Tool.
          Test Plan, Design, Strategy.
          Test Environment setup.
          Test Scripts and Execuution.
          Test Results and Reports.
